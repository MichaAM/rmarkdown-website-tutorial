## Introduction
In this analysis there are 3 models for each school-learning environment analysis: 
Model 1: General DiD with clustered SE at school level 
Model 2: DiD with school and year fixed effects 
Model 3: DiD with school and year fixed effects and additional variables 


### 1. Using computers in language classes 
```{r}
screenreg(list(didreg.lang.jew, didreg.lang.jew.fe, didreg.lang.jew.fe.vars, didreg.lang.arb, didreg.lang.arb.fe, didreg.lang.arb.fe.vars),
          custom.header = list("Jewish sector" = 1:3,  "Arab sector" = 4:6), include.ci = F, stars = c(.1, .05, .01), 
          custom.coef.names = c("Intercept", "Treat", "After", "Reform DiD", "Male indicator", "Mother's years of education", "Father's years of education",
                                "Number of siblings", "Native indicator", "SES index", "Class size", "School age"),
          digits = 3, custom.model.names = c("Model 1", "Model 2", "Model 3", "Model 1", "Model 2", "Model 3"))
